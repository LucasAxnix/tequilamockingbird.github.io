## The Menu

From the main menu you may either:
1. Select the difficulty and proceed to play the game. The higher the difficulty, the more obstacles you will encounter and the stronger the stats of the opponents boats.
2. Change the volume of the in game music
3. Reload the last game that you played (if you have not yet played a game this will be greyed out)

## Boat Selection

After selecting the Difficulty the game will take you to a screen where you will be asked to select a boat you wish to race with. Hovering your mouse over each button will display the unique stats of the boats you can choose from. Selecting a boat will immediately begin the race

## Playing the game

At all times the boat will automatically be accelerating in the direction that it is facing up to its maximum speed. To change the direction of the boat press the “A” key to turn left and the “D” key to turn right. 

As your boat races, your stamina bar goes down. If at any point you are on low stamina, your boat will have a lower high speed and accelerate slower. If you hit an obstacle, your robustness bar will go down and you will reduce your speed for a short while. If you hit too many obstacles so that your robustness bar reduces to 0 then your boat will break and the game will be over.

If you hit a bonus, your boat will gain a buff to a certain stat of the boat depending on which type of bonus you hit. All stats have a maximum value so you may not be able to get the benefit from too many of the same kind of bonus:
1. Tools : repair boat
2. Wheel : better steering
3. Drink : immediate speed increase
4. Wind : increase acceleration
5. Lightning : increase stamina.

If at any point you want to pause, exit or save the game you can press the “Esc” key to enter the pause screen and click the “Exit” button that also saves the state of the game that you can return to any time.
